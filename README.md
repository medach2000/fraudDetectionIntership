# fraudDetectionIntership

The goal is to develop an AI-based application to detect whether a bank transaction is fraudulent:

AI Component (Machine Learning, Training, Models)
Python API to query the generated model
A front-end application with authentication to display the transaction history along with their status (Fraud or not)
A form to submit a transaction and determine if it is fraudulent or not.

This is the back-end part working with SpringBoot
